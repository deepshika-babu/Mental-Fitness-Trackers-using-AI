# Mental-Fitness-Trackers-using-AI

  This project aims to develop a Mental Fitness Tracker powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can compare and evaluate different regression algorithms for predicting mental health outcomes. The tracker will collect diverse mental health-related data of different mental disorders from various countries. A total of 12 regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc. will be implemented and compared using appropriate evaluation metrics. The project's goal is to identify the most accurate and effective regression algorithms to provide users with personalized mental health insights and recommendations through an intuitive user interface. The project's outcomes will contribute to developing a robust and user-centric mental fitness tracker that utilizes AI to promote mental well-being.
